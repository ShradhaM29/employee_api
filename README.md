### Headers
Make sure to include the following headers in your request:
        Key:Content-Type
        Value:application/json
        Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
**Authentication**
The API uses JWT token-based authentication.

Authorization

To access the protected API endpoints, you need to obtain a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. This section will guide you through the process of getting the token and using it in your requests.

1. Creating a Superuser

Before obtaining the token, ensure you have a superuser account, which has permission to access the API.

Steps to Create a Superuser:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Django project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a superuser:
   python manage.py createsuperuser
3. Follow the prompts to enter a username, email address, and password.

2. Get Token:

URL: POST http://localhost:8000/api/token/
Payload:
json
{
  "username": "yourusername",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
Response:
Upon successful authentication, you will receive a response containing the access and refresh tokens
{
  "access": "your_access_token",
  "refresh": "your_refresh_token"
}
